I've been making these Lecca plant pot liners for years now and thought they might be useful to other people. This allows you to make custom liners for any pot that fit perfectly!
The .stl file is just an example. Use the customer, or use the *.scad file with https://openscad.org/


## Instructions to create a pot liner:
 - set is the height of the liner
 - set the top_diameter
 - set the bottom_diameter.


## If you haven't heard of Lecca or semi-hydro before:
It's a great alternative to growing plants with soil. It allows you to have more control of the nutrients given to a plant, minimize pests, monitor water level, and monitor root health :)


## Troubleshooting:
If the holes in the side are overlapping, there are a couple things you can try:
 - try changing the hole_radius to something smaller


## Helpful Tips:
 - It's usually best to make the top_diameter a few mm smaller than the actual diameter
 - Even if the pot is a cylinder and doesn't taper, set bottom_diameter about 10mm smaller than the top_diameter
 - If the print doesn't perfectly fit in a pot, use a small butane torch to reshape it.
 - Use a butane torch to bend the tabs over the edge of the pot.
